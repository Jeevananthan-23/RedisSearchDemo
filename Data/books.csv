There are situations in which we fail for a moment to recognize the person we are with in which the identity of the other is erased while we simultaneously doubt our own. That also happens with couples -- indeed above all with couples because lovers fear more than anything elselosing sight"" of the loved one. With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment Milan Kundera has made this situation -- and the vague sense of panic it inspires -- the very fabric of his new novel. Here brevity goes hand in hand with intensity and a moment of bewilderment marks the start of a labyrinthine journey during which the reader repeatedly crosses the border between the real and the unreal between what occurs in the world outside and what the mind creates in its solitude. Of all contemporary writers only Kundera can transform such a hidden and disconcerting perception into the material for a novel one of his finest most painful and most enlightening.

Focusing on""disruptive technology"" -- the Honda Super Cub Intel's 8088 processor or the hydraulic excavator for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss""the next great wave."" Whether in electronics or retailing a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies The Innovator's Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Find out: When it is right not to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones. Sharp cogent and provocative The Innovator's Dilemma is one of the most talked-about books of our time -- and one no savvy manager or entrepreneur should be without.""",2003,3.99,286,28568

It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important enduring and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies."" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths provides new insights and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups as midsize companies and as large corporations. Throughout the authors asked:""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"" What separates General Electric 3M Merck Wal-Mart Hewlett-Packard Walt Disney and Philip Morris from their rivals? How for example did Procter & Gamble which began life substantially behind rival Colgate eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.""",2004,3.98,368,49529

Grant – a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace serve two terms as president write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president. Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four–star general in the United States Army and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography Michael Korda considers Grant's character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant's life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio his lack of early success in the army and assorted failed business ventures his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general's tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant's presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general's second term ended in financial and political scandals the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war. Ulysses S. Grant is an even–handed and stirring portrait of a man who guided America through a pivotal juncture in its history.",2004,3.88,176,410

One day while strolling Capitol Hill I came upon two townhouses that captured my imagination. The houses were totally different -- a birthday cake of a house and a bran muffin of a house and yet they shared a common wall. I wondered about the people who lived inside the houses.

Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France doubling the size of the nation and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War a lesser-known chapter of his political career when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states and the subsequent war with Tripoli led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and in its shadow the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.,2005,3.92,188,2181

Now in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ one that is critical and at the same time sustaining.Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him "" Borg writes.""Rather it means to give one's heart one's self at its deepest level to . . . the living Lord."" Drawing on his own journey from a naive unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creeds or dogma but in a life of spiritual challenge compassion and community. In straightforward accessible prose Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith bringing alive the many levels of Jesus' character: spirit person teacher of alternative wisdom social prophet and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers doubters and reluctant unbelievers alike Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus' life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith:""For ultimately Jesus is not simply a figure of the past but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus—the living one who comes to us even now—will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time.""",1995,4.14,160,3998

Borg,Religion,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pf0mlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"One of the vital challenges facing thoughtful people today is how to read the Bible faithfully without abandoning our sense of truth and history. Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined—in an approach the author callshistorical-metaphorical."" Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible's origin authority and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation and opens readers to a truer more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyone—whatever one's religious background—to engage the Bible wrestle with its meaning explore its mysteries and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.""",2002,4.13,321,2875

JohnRed"" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James""Whitey"" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer loan shark money launderer and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. While Bulger's other top men turned informant to save their own hides Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be himself a rat.

In prose that is refreshingly honest personal and surprisingly tender Shea tells his harrowing unflinching and unapologetic story.

Who wasjust seventeen"" and made Paul's heart go""boom""? Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where's Penny Lane? In A Hard Day's Write music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four's rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles' music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture's collective imagination. Arranged chronologically by album the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group's writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York 'speech doctor'; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs probed public records and newspaper archives and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public. The result is a book that chronicles an untold story of the Beatles themselves. Illustrated with over 200 photographs A Hard Day's Write is a visually alluring and highly entertaining journey to the land stretching just beneath your conscious mind mapped out with strawberry fields fool-topped hills and long and winding roads.""",2005,4.18,224,152,,,,,,,,,,

Impeccably researched filled with page-turning romance passion and scandal Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen living in an opulent palace wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied admired and revered. She was also miserable having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen a royal ogre who was sadistic foaming at the mouth physically repulsive mentally incompetent or sexually impotent—and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone—swashbuckling generals polished courtiers and virile cardinals—many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover anything could happen—from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen's lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair's implications in terms of power money and factional rivalry. At European courts it was the politics—not the sex—that caused a royal woman's tragedy—or her ultimate triumph.,2006,3.91,336,3676

Their loud and aggressive confrontation became the stuff of instant legend but precisely what happened during that brief confrontation remained for decades the subject of intense disagreement. An engaging mix of philosophy history biography and literary detection Wittgenstein's Poker explores through the Popper/Wittgenstein confrontation the history of philosophy in the twentieth century. It evokes the tumult of fin-de-siécle Vienna Wittgentein's and Popper's birthplace; the tragedy of the Nazi takeover of Austria; and postwar Cambridge University with its eccentric set of philosophy dons including Bertrand Russell. At the center of the story stand the two giants of philosophy themselves -- proud irascible larger than life -- and spoiling for a fight.,2002,3.75,368,2215

Stunning new photographs by Nick Kelsh beautifully complement Carson's intimate account of adventures with her young nephew Roger as they enjoy walks along the rocky coast of Maine and through dense forests and open fields observing wildlife strange plants moonlight and storm clouds and listening to the""living music"" of insects in the underbrush.""If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder."" Writes Carson""he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it rediscovering with him the joy excitement and mystery of the world we live in."" The Sense of Wonder is a refreshing antidote to indifference and a guide to capturing the simple power of discovery that Carson views as essential to life. In her insightful new introduction Linda Lear remembers Rachel Carson's groundbreaking achievements in the context of the legendary environmentalist's personal commitment to introducing young and old to the miracles of nature. Kelsh's lush photographs inspire sensual tactile reactions: masses of leaves floating in a puddle are just waiting to be scooped up and examined more closely. An image of a narrow path through the trees evokes the earthy scent of the woods after a summer rain. Close-ups of mosses and miniature lichen fantasy-lands will spark innocent'as well as more jaded'imaginations. Like a curious child studying things underfoot and within reach Kelsh's camera is drawn to patterns in nature that too often elude hurried adults'a stand of beech trees in the springtime patches of melting snow and the ripples from a pebble tossed into a slow-moving stream. The Sense of Wonder is a timeless volume that will be passed on from children to grandchildren as treasured as the memory of an early-morning walk when the song of a whippoorwill was heard as if for the first time.""",1998,4.39,112,1160

They know the creatures who lived there escaped the impending Big Freeze by inventing the space elevator - they even intervened to rid the planet of a plague of elves who attempted to divert humanity onto a different time track. But now it's all gone wrong - Victorian England has stagnated and the pace of progress would embarrass a limping snail. Unless something drastic is done there won't be time for anyone to invent spaceflight and the human race will be turned into ice-pops. Why though did history come adrift? Was it Sir Arthur Nightingale's dismal book about natural selection? Or was it the devastating response by an obscure country vicar called Charles Darwin whose bestselling Theology of Species made it impossible to refute the divine design of living creatures? Either way it's no easy task to change history as the wizards discover to their cost. Can the God of Evolution come to humanity's aid and ensure Darwin writes a very different book?

An epilogue brings the story up to 1953 when it was written. Koestler calls the book 'a typical case history of a member of the educated middle classes of Central Europe in our time'. It has two main themes: the historical background against which the author developed and an unsparing analysis of his intellectual and spiritual development.,2005,4.35,528,111

A story-telling competition within a group of pilgrims from all walks of life is the occasion for a series of tales that range from the Knight's account of courtly love and the ebullient Wife of Bath's Arthurian legend to the ribald anecdotes of the Miller and the Cook. Rich and diverse The Canterbury tales offers us an unrivalled glimpse into the life and mind of medieval England.

This volume with its erudite introduction by Mario Praz presents three of the most celebrated Gothic novels: The Castle of Otranto published pseudonymously in 1765 is one of the first of the genre and the most truly Gothic of the three. Vathek (1786) an oriental tale by an eccentric millionaire exotically combines Gothic romanticism with the vivacity of The Arabian Nights and is a narrative tour de force. The story of Frankenstein (1818) and the monster he created is as spine-chilling today as it ever was; as in all Gothic novels horror is the keynote.

In depicting Martin�s journey � an experience that teaches him to question his inherited self-interest and egotism � Dickens created many vividly realized figures: the brutish lout Jonas Chuzzlewit plotting to gain the family fortune; Martin�s optimistic manservant Mark Tapley; gentle Tom Pinch; and the drunken and corrupt private nurse Mrs Gamp. With its portrayal of greed blackmail and murder and its searing satire on America Dickens�s novel is a powerful and blackly comic story of hypocrisy and redemption.,1999,3.83,830,12722

Denounced as vulgar by the literary establishment Three Men in a Boat nevertheless caught the spirit of the times. The expansion of education and the increase in office workers created a new mass readership and Jerome's book was especially popular among the 'clerking classes' who longed to be 'free from that fretful haste that vehement striving that is every day becoming more and more the bane of nineteenth-century life.' So popular did it prove that Jerome reunited his heroes for a bicycle tour of Germany. Despite some sharp and with hindsight prophetic observations of the country Three Men on the Bummel describes an equally picaresque journey constrained only 'by the necessity of getting back within a given time to the point from which one started'.,1999,4.09,400,2243

Daniel Defoe was just five at the time of the plague but he later called on his own memories as well as his writing experience to create this vivid chronicle of the epidemic and its victims. 'A Journal' (1722) follows Defoe's fictional narrator as he traces the devastating progress of the plague through the streets of London. Here we see a city transformed: some of its streets suspiciously empty some - with crosses on their doors - overwhelmingly full of the sounds and smells of human suffering.

In Prometheus Bound the defiant Titan Prometheus is brutally punished by Zeus for daring to improve the state of wretchedness and servitude in which mankind is kept. The Suppliants tells the story of the fifty daughters of Danaus who must flee to escape enforced marriages while Seven Against Thebes shows the inexorable downfall of the last members of the cursed family of Oedipus.

Iphigenia depicts a princess’s absolute submission to her father’s will despite his determination to sacrifice her to gain divine favour before going to war. Described by Voltaire as ‘the masterpiece of the human mind’ Phaedra shows a woman’s struggle to overcome her overwhelming passion for her stepson – an obsession that brings destruction to a noble family.

Siegfried a great prince of the Netherlands wins the hand of the beautiful princess Kriemhild of Burgundy by aiding her brother Gunther in his struggle to seduce a powerful Icelandic Queen. But the two women quarrel and Siegfried is ultimately destroyed by those he trusts the most.

In 'The Frogs ' written in the darkest days of the Peloponnesian War the god Dionysus descends to the Underworld to find a poet to bring back: does Athens in her hour of danger need the traditional wisdom of Aeschylus or the brilliant modern cleverness of Euripides?

In Rameau's Nephew the eccentric and foolish nephew of the great composer Jean-Philippe Rameau meets Diderot by chance and the two embark on a hilarious consideration of society music literature politics morality and philosophy. Its companion-piece D'Alembert's Dream outlines a material atheistic view of the universe expressed through the fevered dreams of Diderot's friend D'Alembert.

The Gambler is a breathtaking portrayal of an intense and futile obsession.

When these relatives become aware of the true value of his art collection however their sneering contempt for the parasitic Pons rapidly falls away as they struggle to obtain a piece of the weakening man's inheritance. Taking its place in the Human Comedy as a companion to Cousin Bette the darkly humorous Cousin Pons is among of the last and greatest of Balzac's novels concerning French urban society: a cynical pessimistic but never despairing consideration of human nature.",2006,3.99,336,894,,,,,,,,,
